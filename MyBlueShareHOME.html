<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am a undergraduate programmer who codes for fun. But plottwist! I'm a woman. 
That shouldn't be too suprising. We all have different interests and hobbies. We all have different personalities and traits.  
I just happen to grow up in a environment where going on the computer is the only way to 
relieve me from boredom or stress. As a hobby, I tend to create things such as 2D or 3D animations,
3D modeling, mini video games, digital drawings and programs. In the future, I'll create mobile apps starting with Android. 
Why did I chose Computer Science as my major? I'm so curious about the many topics in Computer Science. cyber security, 
networking, artificial intellgence, databases, web development, mobile app development, you name it. Everyday I'm surrounded 
by these amazing things and I want to learn more about them by coding it all out.</p>
<h3>How it all started</h3>
<p>I remembered 
that I had coded way before I took any CS courses. I coded in basic HTML when I was a little girl during the time when I was 
making my own websites. I also got exposed to CSS when I tried to learn how to make tumblr pages for people. I volunteered to be 
part of tech support in high school and I thought that made me got interested in majoring in something that involves computers. 
It wasn't. The fact that I spend most of my days facing a computer screen is the cause. When I took my first CS course, our
assignments required to code in Java, causing it to be the first coding language that I became proficient in. 
It was during the time when I forgot all about HTML. But now, I am learning many other programming languages, and self-teaching myself 
things that are technology-related</p>
<p>I like to share my works with other people because I don't want to enjoy what I  myself.</p>
